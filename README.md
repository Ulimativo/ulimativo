<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ulimativ.</h1>
<h3 align="center">A Full-Time Marketing Professional and Hobby Developer.</h3>

<p>I started coding back in the early 1990s with Logo, Pascal and Basic. In the late 90ies I started coding websites in HTML, PHP, SQL, CSS, JavaScript as a side hustle, then moving on to Flash Animatins during my studies in the early 2000s. Fast forward I discovered Python during experimenting with physical computing (Arduino first, then moving on to Raspberry Pi and Python). Still curious about all that stuff despite my main job in Marketing.
